                <p class="paragraph-web">Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
                    led by
                    web
                    development include
                    e-com-merce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and
                    purchase
                    goods
                    and servic-es. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have
                    transformed the
                    shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.

                <h3>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-web">Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
                    growing
                    industry.The growth of this
                    industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
                    services to
                    customers.(1)
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-web"> There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB,
                    GlassFish, LAMP
                    (Linux, Apache,
                    MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack.This has kept the cost of learning web development to a
                    minimum.
                    Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
                    easy-to-use
                    WYSIWYG
                    web-develop-ment software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual
                    Studio.
                    Knowledge
                    of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use
                    such
                    software,
                    but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files,
                    technical
                    books,
                    internet tutorials, or face-to-face training.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-web">
                    An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic
                    and
                    interactive
                    websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which
                    were
                    traditionally only available as applica-tions on a desk-based computer. This has allowed
                    for
                    many
                    opportunities to de-centralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen
                    with the
                    rise of
                    cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs.These web services
                    allow
                    users to
                    interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific
                    workstation
                    for
                    their application environment.
